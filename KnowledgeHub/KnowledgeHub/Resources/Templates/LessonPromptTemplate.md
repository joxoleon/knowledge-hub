### Introduction to AI:

You are creating a structured lesson on software engineering concepts for a learning app. This lesson will help users prepare for interviews and deepen their understanding of iOS development, software engineering, and architecture concepts. While the lesson library will eventually expand to cover advanced topics, the current focus is interview preparation for iOS and software engineering.

---

### Lesson Requirements:

#### Format and Structure:

1. **Output**: Format the final lesson as a **single Markdown file (.md)** that follows a consistent structure for readability and compatibility with Markdown editors. **Each section should have a clear delimiter**.

2. **Follow this Rigid Structure with Delimiters**:

   - **Metadata Section**:
     - Begin with metadata in JSON-like format.
     - Include:
        - `id`: A unique identifier in lowercase, underscore-separated format (e.g., `"solid_principles"`).
        - `title`: The lesson title.
        - `description`: A brief description of the lesson’s purpose.

   - **Sections**:
     - **Definition and Introduction**: 
        - Use the delimiter `=== Section: [Title] Introduction ===` to start this section (replace `[Title]` with the lesson title).
        - Start with a clear, descriptive heading for the introduction.
        - Provide a concise definition and introduction, focusing on the topic’s purpose and significance.
        - Emphasize key definitions or principles with quotation blocks (e.g., `> Dependency Injection is...`).
        - Use **bold** formatting to highlight important acronyms, terms, or phrases that should be easily memorable.
        - End this section with the delimiter `=== EndSection: [Title] Introduction ===`.
       
     - **Full Lesson**: 
       - Use the delimiter `=== Section: [Title] ===` to begin the main content section.
       - Start with a heading that describes the section appropriately.
       - Provide a thorough, structured explanation of the topic. Include all necessary details, examples, best practices, and relevant code snippets.
       - **Do not be stingy with examples**: Whenever a concept would benefit from one, provide a clear, relevant example, whether it be a code snippet or an illustrative scenario. Use sensible formatting and indentation for code examples.
       - Avoid using "```" for code blocks; instead, indent code with spaces to ensure smooth text flow.
       - **Subsections**: If the lesson covers multiple concepts, split the Full Lesson into up to 5-6 subsections only if needed for distinct topics. 
       - End this section with the delimiter `=== EndSection: [Title] ===`.
       
     - **Discussion**: 
       - Use the delimiter `=== Section: Discussion ===` to start the discussion.
       - Cover the topic’s pros, cons, common use cases, or comparisons with related concepts to provide a broader context.
       - End this section with the delimiter `=== EndSection: Discussion ===`.
       
     - **Key Takeaways**: 
       - Use the delimiter `=== Section: Key Takeaways ===`.
       - Summarize the lesson with concise, flashcard-friendly points.
       - End this section with the delimiter `=== EndSection: Key Takeaways ===`.

3. **Questions Section**:
   - Conclude the lesson with a set of multiple-choice questions in JSON-like format.
   - **Each question should include**:
     - `id`: A unique identifier based on the lesson ID and question number (e.g., `"solid_principles_q1"`).
     - `type`: `"multiple_choice"`.
     - `proficiency`: The difficulty level (e.g., `"basic"`, `"intermediate"`, or `"advanced"`).
     - `question`: The question text, formatted as a markdown string.
     - **Complexity and Variability**: While questions can be short, they may also be complex when beneficial for comprehension. For example, questions can include indented code blocks or diagrams for reference.
     - `answers`: An array of answer choices.
     - `correctAnswerIndex`: Index of the correct answer within the `answers` array.
     - `explanation`: A markdown-formatted explanation that clarifies why the correct answer is right and why other options are incorrect.
   - **Requirements**:
     - Generate at least 5 well-thought-out questions that test different facets of the lesson topic, helping reinforce core concepts.

4. **Quality and Readability**:
    - Use clear, professional language suitable for an advanced audience.
    - Ensure examples are easily understandable and demonstrate real-world applicability.
    - Write high-quality, concise key takeaways suitable for flashcard-style review.
    - Emphasize important keywords or concepts using **bold** formatting in all sections of the lesson, but apply sparingly and only to essential terms:
        - For example, highlight terms like **SOLID principles** in a lesson on SOLID, or emphasize **contract** and **blueprint** when discussing protocols in Swift.
    - Structure paragraphs and explanations to be professional yet easy to read. Avoid large text blocks by formatting with readable spacing and breaking down complex explanations.

### Sample Lesson

**Title/Topic**: Dependency Injection in iOS

**Focus**: Introduce Dependency Injection (DI) and demonstrate how it can improve code modularity and testability in iOS development, including practical code examples.

---

**Instructions to AI**:

Generate a markdown lesson with the following structure:

1. Metadata:
    { 
        "id": "dependency_injection", 
        "title": "Dependency Injection in iOS", 
        "description": "An introductory lesson on Dependency Injection and its benefits in iOS applications."
    }

2. Sections:
    - `=== Section: Dependency Injection Introduction ===`
      Provide a short, concise definition of Dependency Injection, explaining its purpose in software engineering.
      `=== EndSection: Dependency Injection Introduction ===`

    - `=== Section: Dependency Injection ===`
      Provide an in-depth explanation of Dependency Injection, covering what it is, why it’s beneficial, and how it can be implemented in iOS. Include examples to show how DI can make code more modular and testable. Avoid using "```" for code blocks; indent instead to maintain text flow.
      `=== EndSection: Dependency Injection ===`

    - `=== Section: Discussion ===`
      Discuss the pros and cons of Dependency Injection, alternative approaches, and real-world applications where DI is especially useful in iOS development.
      `=== EndSection: Discussion ===`

    - `=== Section: Key Takeaways ===`
      Summarize the main points with concise, flashcard-friendly statements.
      `=== EndSection: Key Takeaways ===`

      [
          {
              "id": "dependency_injection_q1",
              "type": "multiple_choice",
              "proficiency": "basic",
              "question": "What is Dependency Injection?",
              "answers": [
                  "A way to protect data within an object",
                  "A method to manage object dependencies",
                  "A programming loop",
                  "A type of data structure"
              ],
              "correctAnswerIndex": 1,
              "explanation": "Dependency Injection is a design pattern that manages dependencies by injecting them, making code more modular and testable."
          },
          // Additional questions following the same structure
      ]
