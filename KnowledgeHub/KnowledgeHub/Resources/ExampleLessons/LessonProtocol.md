# Protocols in Swift

## Definition and Introduction

**Protocol** is a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that a class, struct, or enum can adopt to provide functionality. Protocols play a crucial role in Swift’s type system by allowing code to be flexible and reusable. In iOS development, protocols are widely used for delegation, data sources, and to create adaptable components.

## Full Lesson

In Swift, protocols define the requirements for behavior and properties that a conforming type (such as a class, struct, or enum) must implement. Protocols do not contain actual implementation; instead, they specify the requirements that the adopter must fulfill. This structure supports code modularity, testing, and cleaner architecture by promoting loose coupling between components.

### Declaring a Protocol

To declare a protocol in Swift, use the `protocol` keyword followed by the protocol’s name and a set of method or property requirements. Here’s a basic example:

    protocol Drivable {
        var speed: Int { get set }
        func drive()
    }

In this `Drivable` protocol, any type that conforms to it must provide an integer `speed` and a `drive()` method.

### Conforming to a Protocol

Types conform to a protocol by implementing all its required properties and methods. Conformance is declared by adding the protocol name after the type name.

    struct Car: Drivable {
        var speed: Int
        func drive() {
            print("The car is driving at \(speed) km/h.")
        }
    }

Here, `Car` adopts the `Drivable` protocol and implements the `speed` property and `drive()` method as required.

### Using Protocols with Classes and Structs

Protocols are commonly used to enable polymorphism, allowing different types to be treated as if they were the same. This is particularly useful in dependency injection, testing, and when building flexible iOS components.

    protocol SoundPlayable {
        func playSound()
    }

    class Bird: SoundPlayable {
        func playSound() {
            print("Tweet tweet!")
        }
    }

    class Dog: SoundPlayable {
        func playSound() {
            print("Woof woof!")
        }
    }

In the above code, both `Bird` and `Dog` conform to the `SoundPlayable` protocol. This allows both to be treated as `SoundPlayable`, enabling flexible code.

### Protocols and Delegation

Delegation is a design pattern that enables one object to act on behalf of another. In iOS, delegation is commonly implemented with protocols, especially for tasks like table view data sources.

    protocol TableViewDelegate {
        func didSelectRow(at index: Int)
    }

    class TableView {
        var delegate: TableViewDelegate?

        func selectRow(at index: Int) {
            delegate?.didSelectRow(at: index)
        }
    }

    class ViewController: TableViewDelegate {
        func didSelectRow(at index: Int) {
            print("Row \(index) was selected.")
        }
    }

In this example, `TableView` uses a delegate of type `TableViewDelegate` to notify `ViewController` when a row is selected, creating a flexible and modular design.

### Protocol Composition

Swift allows types to conform to multiple protocols. Protocol composition can be used to define a type requirement by combining multiple protocols.

    protocol Flyable {
        func fly()
    }

    protocol Drivable {
        var speed: Int { get set }
        func drive()
    }

    struct FlyingCar: Flyable, Drivable {
        var speed: Int

        func fly() {
            print("Flying at speed \(speed)")
        }

        func drive() {
            print("Driving at speed \(speed)")
        }
    }

In this example, `FlyingCar` conforms to both `Flyable` and `Drivable`, demonstrating how a type can fulfill multiple roles.

## Discussion

### Pros of Using Protocols

- **Modularity**: Protocols allow developers to create modular and reusable code by defining behaviors that multiple types can adopt.
- **Loose Coupling**: By relying on protocols rather than concrete types, code components can be swapped easily, making testing and scaling simpler.
- **Adaptability**: Protocols are instrumental in enabling design patterns like delegation and dependency injection, commonly used in iOS.

### Cons of Using Protocols

- **Complexity**: Overuse of protocols can lead to complexity, as tracking multiple protocol implementations may become difficult.
- **Performance**: Protocols may introduce a small performance overhead due to dynamic dispatch when using protocol-oriented polymorphism.
- **Learning Curve**: Understanding when and how to use protocols effectively can be challenging for new Swift developers.

### Common Use Cases

1. **Delegation**: Used for handling UI interactions in table views, collection views, etc.
2. **Decoupling Dependencies**: Enables dependency injection by providing interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
3. **Testing**: Protocols allow for easy substitution of mock objects during testing, making unit tests more manageable and effective.

## Key Takeaways

- Protocols define behavior that types can adopt without implementing the actual behavior.
- They support flexibility, modularity, and reusability in Swift, making them essential for iOS development.
- Protocol-oriented programming in Swift allows developers to write more testable, adaptable code by reducing dependencies between components.
- Common use cases include delegation, dependency injection, and interface abstraction.
